        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. Remember this. Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege. Remember this. Try.

        <h2>Gray Jedi</h2>
        <p>
          Lastly, there have been some that try to toe the line between the Light Side and the Dark Side of the Force, and they are generally called Grey Jedi. The closest we‚Äôve seen in the films is Mace Windu, who used a form of combat that relied on the user allowing themselves to draw from their passion during combat, which was reflected in his purple lightsaber.

Belief that the Force isn‚Äôt specifically divided into Light and Dark is prominent in the belief of the Unifying Force. Unfortunately no one on the Jedi Council seemed to follow this belief in the Force, as the Jedi were dogmatic in their pursuit of cutting themselves off of half of the Force‚Äôs power.
